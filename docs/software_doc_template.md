<!--- Limit this to no more than a few paragraphs. Brief description 
of what the tool does, and possibly a few high level use cases. -->  


## Installation
<!--- Should contain very clear command-line instructions. -->
### Dependencies
<!--- Include all known code dependencies. Disambiguate between build vs. 
runtime dependencies, if relevant. --> 
### Build
<!--- If necessary, clear scons steps to make a clean build. Not required for
Python code (unless it involves Cython). -->
### Install
<!--- Anything required to install/configure before using the software. Python
code should discuss pip/virtualenv set up. -->
### Test
<!--- Guidance on running unit tests. -->

## Known Issues
<!--- Include known issues/caveats/bugs/errata, so users know what to expect
before using tool. -->

## User Manual 
<!--- Should walk through all command-line options (or defer to a --help call,
if desired). Include invocation examples and scenarios that exhibit all critical
command-line options and use cases. -->
