# These standard modules get marked as required by 'pip freeze' due to Python
# 2.7's standard module packaging. These will not be marked as required if
# Python 3.3+ is used. We document the minimum required versions here just for
# completeness, and so future users understand why these might appear in the
# 'pip freeze' output.
