\section{Empirical Evaluation: Supported Query Types}
\label{sec:emp_dbs_supportedquerytypes}

The following table describes the atomic query types supported by {{config.performername}}.
In this table, `pass' indicates that {{config.performername}} passed tests successfully (i.e. at least one query was executed correctly), 
`fail' indicates that {{config.performername}} failed the tests (i.e. did not execute a single query correctly), 
`-' indicates that no tests were run because {{config.performername}} indicated that they do not support the given functionality, and 
`N/A' indicates that queries of the given type do not apply to the given data type.

The following table describes the composite query types supported by {{config.performername}}.
