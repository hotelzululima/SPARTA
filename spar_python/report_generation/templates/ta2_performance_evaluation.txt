\subsection{Evaluation}
\label{sec:emp_he_evaluation}

Evaluation time was highly correlated with {{ config.var_depth }} and {{ config.var_numbatches }}. It also showed a little correlation with {{ config.var_batchsize }}, which again we believe is a result of parameters being selected jointly. We graph evaluation time as a function of {{ config.var_numbatches }} and {{ config.var_depth }}, and provide best-fit models of evaluation time as a function of {{ config.var_numbatchs }} and {{config.var_depth }} as well as of evaluation time as a function of {{ config.var_numbatchs}}, {{ config.var_depth }} and  {{ config.var_batchsize }}.
In addition, evaluation time will be affected by the choice of the security parameter {{ config.var_secparam }}. Since only two values of {{ config.var_secparam }} were tested, we present data captured using each security parameter, ${{ config.var_secparam }} = 80$ and ${{ config.var_secparam }} = 128$, separately. 

The best-fit model for ${{ config.var_secparam }} = 80$ is$${{ outp.evaluation_functionstr80 }}$$
with an $r^2$ value of ${{ outp.evaluation_rsquared80 }}$.

Including {{ config.var_batchsize }}, the best-fit model for ${{ config.var_secparam }} = 80$ is 
$${{ outp.evaluation_complexfunctionstr80 }}$$
with an $r^2$ value of ${{ outp.evaluation_complexrsquared80 }}$.

The best-fit model for ${{ config.var_secparam }} = 128$ is$${{ outp.evaluation_functionstr128 }}$$
with an $r^2$ value of ${{ outp.evaluation_rsquared128 }}$.

Including {{ config.var_batchsize }}, the best-fit model for ${{ config.var_secparam }} = 128$ is 
$${{ outp.evaluation_complexfunctionstr128 }}$$
with an $r^2$ value of ${{ outp.evaluation_complexrsquared128 }}$.

Table \ref{tab:evaluatedciphertextsizes} and Figure \ref{fig:evaluatedciphertextsizes} provide descriptive statistics for evaluated ciphertext sizes.
