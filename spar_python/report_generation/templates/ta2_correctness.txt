\section{Empirical Evaluation: Correctness}
\label{sec:emp_he_correctness}

In this section, we present all of the correctness metrics observed during our tests of {{config.performerprototype}}.
These metrics are aggregated over all of the tested databases and presented together, since we do not expect correctness to be impacted by database size.

The correctness definitions given in the Test Plan state that 
\emph{circuit evaluation accuracy} is the fraction of circuit evaluations which were correct.
Additionally, we provide 
the \emph{count} (the total number of queries run), 
the \emph{circuit precision} (the probability that an evaluation should output 1 given that it did output 1), and 
the \emph{circuit recall} (the probability that an evaluation outputs 1 given that it should).

The query correctness results in Table \ref{tab:corr} were observed during the tests performed on {{config.performerprototype}}.
