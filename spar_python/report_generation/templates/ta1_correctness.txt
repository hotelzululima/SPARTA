\section{Empirical Evaluation: Database Correctness}
\label{sec:emp_dbs_correctness}

In this section, we present all of the correctness metrics observed during our tests of {{config.performerprototype}}.
These metrics are aggregated over all of the tested databases and presented together, since we do not expect correctness to be impacted by database size.
