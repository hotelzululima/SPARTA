\subsection{Query Correctness}
\label{sec:emp_dbs_correctness_query}

The query correctness definitions given in the Test Plan state that 
\emph{query precision} is the probability that a record matches the query given that it was returned, 
and that \emph{query recall} is the probability that a record is returned given that it matches the query.
Additionally, we provide the \emph{bcf}, or \emph{bad content fraction} (the probability that the content of a record was returned corrupted), 
the \emph{nbr}, or \emph{number of bad rankings} (the number of P9 queries which were incorrectly ranked), 
the \emph{count} (the total number of queries run), 
and the \emph{num failed}, or \emph{number of failures} (the number of queries resulting in failed messages, which are not counted towards any of the other metrics) for each query type.

The query correctness results in Table \ref{tab:query_corr} were observed during the tests performed on {{config.performerprototype}}.
