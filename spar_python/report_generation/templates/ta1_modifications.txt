\subsection{Modifications}
\label{sec:emp_dbs_modifications}

For each modification type, we provide 
\begin{itemize}
\item the number of modifications run, 
\item the number of modifications that failed (not counted towards any further metrics),
\item the number of modifications that didn't have sufficient accompanying info (such as pre-modification queries) to determine correctness (not counted towards any further metrics), 
\item the number of modifications which were determined to have been incorrectly executed through post-modification queries,
\item the number of modifications which were determined to have been correctly executed through post-modification queries, 
\item the smallest latency between the completion of a modification and the completion of a correct post-modification query, and 
\item the largest latency between the completion of a modification and the completion of an incorrect post-modification query.
\end{itemize}

The modification results in Table \ref{tab:mods} were observed during the tests performed on {{config.performerprototype}}.
